When you ask your browser for 
a web page, the request is sent 
across the Internet to a special 
computer known as a web 
server which hosts the website.


All websites use HTML and CSS, but content 
management systems, blogging software, and 
e-commerce platforms often add a few more 
technologies into the mix.


When WE visit a website, the web server 
hosting that site could be anywhere in the 
world. In order for you to find the location of 
the web server, your browser will first connect 
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

The use of headings and 
subheadings in any document 
often reflects a hierarchy of 
information. For example, a 
document might start with 
a large heading, followed by 
an introduction or the most 
important information.

Before the <body> element you 
will often see a <head> element. 
This contains information 
about the page (rather than 
information that is shown within 
the main part of the browser 
window that is highlighted in 
blue on the opposite page). 
You will usually find a <title>
element inside the <head>
element.


The <form> element uses the action attribute to indicate the page that 
the data is being sent to. Each of the form controls sits inside the <form>
element. Different types of form control are suited to collecting different 
types of data. The <fieldset> element is used to group related 
questions together. The <label> element indicates the purpose of each form control.

If you want to add a comment 
to your code that will not be 
visible in the user's browser, you 
can add the text between these 
characters:
<!-- comment goes here --

Every HTML element can 
also carry a class attribute. 
Sometimes, rather than uniquely 
identifying one element within 
a document, you will want a 
way to identify several elements 
as being different from the 
other elements on the page. 
For example, you might have 
some paragraphs of text that 
contain information that is more 
important than others and want 
to distinguish these elements, or 
you might want to differentiate 
between links that point to other 
pages on your own site and links 
that point to external sites. 

<div> chapter-08/grouping-block-elements.html HTML
The <div> element allows you to 
group a set of elements together 
in one block-level box.
For example, you might create 
a <div> element to contain all 
of the elements for the header 
of your site (the logo and the 
navigation), or you might create 
a <div> element to contain 
comments from visitors.


The <meta> element lives 
inside the <head> element and 
contains information about that 
web page.


A background texture is applied to the whole page by repeating an 
image with the texture behind the <body> element. A repeating 
background image is sometimes referred to as wallpaper.

To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.

The <aside> element has two 
purposes, depending on whether 
it is inside an <article>
element or not.

The purpose of the <hgroup>
element is to group together a 
set of one or more <h1> through 
<h6> elements so that they are 
treated as one single heading. 
For example, the <hgroup>
element could be used to contain 
both a title inside an <h2>
element and a subtitle within an 
<h3> element.


HTML5 allows web page authors 
to place an <a> element around 
a block level element that 
contains child elements. This 
allows you to turn an entire block 
into a link.


The header and footer of the page sit inside <header> and <footer>
elements. The courses are grouped together inside a <section>
element that has a class attribute whose value is courses (to 
distinguish it from other <section> elements on the page). The sidebar 
sits inside an <aside> element.

Every website should be designed for the 
target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the 
site owner. It is therefore very important to 
understand who your target audience is.

It is unlikely that you will be able to list every 
reason why someone visits your site but you 
are looking for key tasks and motivations. This 
information can help guide your site designs.

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key 
information that needs to go on each page of a 
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information 
and how much space it might require.

Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find 
information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets 
across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.

A script is a series of instructions that the computer 
can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of 
all the instructions. 
Computers approach tasks in a different way than 
humans, so your instructions must let the computer 
solve the task prggrammatically. 
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into 
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed 
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

Methods represent things people need to do with objects. They can 
retrieve or update the values of an object's properties.

Computers use data to create models of things in the real world. 
The events, methods, and properties of an object all relate to each other: 
Events can trigger methods, and methods can retrieve or update an 
object's properties.


Using the document object, you can access and change what content 
users see on the page and respond to how they interact with it.
