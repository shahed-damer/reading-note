The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional.

Using the scale value within the transform property allows me to change the appeared size of an element.

skew, is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both. 

The distance calculation of the skew value is measured in units of degrees.


 transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state.


 There are four transition related properties in total: 
transition-property
transition-duration 
transition-timing-function
transition-delay


Fade in effects are coded in two steps: first, I set the initial state; next, I set the change.
