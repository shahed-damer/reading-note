 that the Modern browsers come with tools that help 
us inspect the page loaded in the browser 
and understand the structure of the DOM tree. and Firefox has similar built-in tools, but we can 
also download a DOM inspector tool that 
shows the text nodes. 


also firefox a 3D view of 
the DOM, where a box is drawn 
around each element, and you 
can change the angle of the 
page to show which parts of it 
stick out more than others. The 
further they protrude the further 
into child elements they appear. 

I can select element nodes by their id or cl ass 
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax. 
Whenever a DOM query can return more than one 
node, it will always return a Nadel i st. 
From an element node, you can access and update its 
content using properties such as textContent and 
i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques. 
An element node can contain multiple text nodes and 
child elements that are siblings of each other. 
In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is 
inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery). 
Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .

#EVENTS TRIGGER CODE 

s, it can be used saw how the DOM can 
or swipe over an element, to trigger a particular be used to update a page. 
t ype on the keyboard, function. 


whats is the event Event listeners?
they  are a more recent approach to handling events. 
They can deal with more than one function at a time 
but they are not supported in older browsers.and we can use barameters with them.




Using if else statement, I can check if the 
browser supports the addEventL i stener() method. 
The condition in the if statement will return true 
if the browser supports the addEventL i stener() 
method, and you can use it. If the browser does not 
support that method, it returns false, and the code 
will try to use the attachEvent () method.



The <table> element is used to add tables to a web 
page.
X A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created 
with the <tr> element.
X Inside each row there are a number of cells 
represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a 
header).
X You can make cells of a table span more than one row 
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
X For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, 
<tbody>, and <tfoot>

there are a  several types of form controls that 
I can use to collect information from visitors 
to my site
Form Controls
ADDING TEXT:
Making Choices:
Submitting Forms: Uploading Files:
Password input
Like a single line text box but it 
masks the characters entered.
Text input (single-line)
Used for a single line of text such 
as email addresses and names.


CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box. 
I can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
I can also control the borders, margin and padding 
for each box with CSS.
 It is possible to hide elements using the display and 
visibility properties.
 Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and 
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
X Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of 
boxes containing text and the leading.

SOME PROPRITES THAT I CAN USE IN CSS

width to set the width of the 
table
padding to set the space 
between the border of each table 
cell and its content.


List markers can be given different appearances 
using the list-style-type and list-style image 
properties.


Fixed width layout 
designs do not 
change size as the 
user increases 
or decreases 
the size of their 
browser window.
