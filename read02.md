Git is an open-source version control system. It was designed and developed by Linus Torvalds (creator of the Linux kernel) and is the most popular version control system to date.

Git helps out a lot with respect to incremental code development and documentation.
Git is relatively easy to pick up and learn.
Git is very efficient and will not adversely affect your code.
If you make a mistake with your code, Git can easily revert you back to a working version of your code.
You can easily maintain multiple backups of your code that can update themselves without you needing to copy/paste your code over.
You can review the history of your code.
You can make multiple versions of your code.
You can work on experimental changes or features without breaking your working code.
You can keep track of contributions to the code when working as part of a team.
Companies use version control, so you will need to learn version control eventually.
