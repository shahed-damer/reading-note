Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors within a script. 

I can activate it by pricing of f 12 then choose console from the menu , when there is no debug the debug will have no effect.

the syntax is debugger

js use execution contexts we have the global context
function context,eval context,global scope,function-levelscope.

there are many types of errors (general,syntax,reference error,type,type,range,url,eval.et)

i can fix the error by goinig to my browser and choose web develper then choose console 
i can create abreak point in the code by typing debugger and i can place it with condition to trigger the breakpoint 
and be shure to remove the statment before i run the code .

i can create my own error to help me with solving the proplems in the code by using throw new error ('massage')and descripe what is the proplem.


 there is some common errors in js like (go back to basic,missed or extra characters , data type issues).
