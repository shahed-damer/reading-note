The definition list is created with 
the <dl> element and usually 
consists of a series of terms and 
their definitions.

Definition lists are used to define terminolog.

Links are the defining feature of the web 
because they allow you to move from 
one web page to another — enabling the 
very idea of browsing or surfing.

Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything 
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify 
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.


Links are created using the <a>
element which has an attribute 
called href. The value of the 
href attribute is the page that 
you want people to go to when 
they click on the link.


The diagram on the right shows 
the directory structure for a 
fictional entertainment listings 
website called ExampleArts.

Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own 
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to 
find your files.

Same Folder
To link to a file in the same folder, just use the file 
name. (Nothing else is needed.)
Child Folder
For a child folder, use the name of the child folder, 
followed by a forward slash, then the file name.

To create a link that starts up 
the user's email program and 
addresses an email to a specified 
email address, you use the <a>
element. However, this time the 
value of the href attribute starts 
with mailto: and is followed by 
the email address you want the 
email to be sent to.

If you want a link to open in a 
new window, you can use the 
target attribute on the opening 
<a> tag. The value of this 
attribute should be _blank.

List markers can be given different appearances 
using the list-style-type and list-style image 
properties.

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its 
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.


To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use 
box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom 
and left or right it should be placed. 


Relative positioning moves an 
element in relation to where it 
would have been in normal flow.


Fixed positioning is a type 
of absolute positioning that 
requires the position property 
to have a value of fixed.


Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some 
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most 
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.


Pages expand to fill the entire 
browser window so there are 
no spaces around the page 
on a large screen.

To create a fixed width layout, 
the width of the main boxes on 
a page will usually be specified 
in pixels (and sometimes their 
height, too).

CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for 
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating 
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS 
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.


Some web page authors split 
up their CSS style rules into 
separate style sheets. For 
example, they might use one 
style sheet to control the layout 
and another to control fonts, 
colors and so on.

Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.


The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.


Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

For most roles, the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills. Pair programming strengthens all of those skills.
