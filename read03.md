A wireframe is a basic, two-dimensional visual representation of a web page, app interface, or product layout. You can think of it as a low-fidelity, functional sketch. Product designers and UX (user experience) professionals draw up wireframes to communicate how they plan to arrange and prioritize features, and how they intend for users to interact with its product or website.

Wireframes typically depict only functionality, not the true style and visual elements of the final product. It’s why most wireframes look simple: grayscale instead of colors, placeholders for images, and Lorem Ipsum for text.
Wireframes help product organizations both visually communicate and document their plans for developing products or sites. It can help ensure the entire cross-functional team is on the same page in terms of strategic goals before beginning development work.

Here are a few examples of what wireframes can do for an organization:

Communicate the team’s decisions about which functionality and content to prioritize in the product or site.
Depict how the team envisions users to interact with the product or site.
Document and communicate how various aspects of the app or website will connect.
Establish consistent ways of displaying particular content across the site.
Clarify for stakeholders across the company the product team’s plans for the product and the user experience. (This is why wireframes can serve as a helpful complement to the product roadmap in executive stakeholder meetings.)
