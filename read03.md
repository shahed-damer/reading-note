A wireframe is a basic, two-dimensional visual representation of a web page, app interface, or product layout. You can think of it as a low-fidelity, functional sketch. Product designers and UX (user experience) professionals draw up wireframes to communicate how they plan to arrange and prioritize features, and how they intend for users to interact with its product or website.

Wireframes typically depict only functionality, not the true style and visual elements of the final product. It’s why most wireframes look simple: grayscale instead of colors, placeholders for images, and Lorem Ipsum for text.
Wireframes help product organizations both visually communicate and document their plans for developing products or sites. It can help ensure the entire cross-functional team is on the same page in terms of strategic goals before beginning development work.

Here are a few examples of what wireframes can do for an organization:

Communicate the team’s decisions about which functionality and content to prioritize in the product or site.
Depict how the team envisions users to interact with the product or site.
Document and communicate how various aspects of the app or website will connect.
Establish consistent ways of displaying particular content across the site.
Clarify for stakeholders across the company the product team’s plans for the product and the user experience. (This is why wireframes can serve as a helpful complement to the product roadmap in executive stakeholder meetings.)
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

 HTML
HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  

 **Semantics** is the study of the meaning of words and sentences; at its simplest, it concerns with the relation of linguistic forms to non-linguistic concepts and mental representations in order to explain how sentences are understood by the speakers of a language.
To build websites, you should know about HTML — the fundamental technology used to define the structure of a webpage. HTML is used to specify whether your web content should be recognized as a paragraph, list, heading, link, image, multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or even a new element that you define.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

**Mozilla HTML**"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
