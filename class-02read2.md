The <address> element has 
quite a specific use: to contain 
contact details for the author of 
the page.

Browsers often display the 
content of the <address>
element in italics.

The content of a <ins> element 
is usually underlined, while the 
content of a <del> element 
usually has a line through it.

There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume 
most people will have installed.
X If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are 
several options, but you need to have the right license 
to use them.


hidden
This property simply hides any 
extra content that does not fit in 
the box.


If you specify a width 
for a box, then the 
borders, margin, and 
padding are added to 
its width and height


Designers refer to the space 
between items on a page as 
white space. Imagine you had 
a border around a box. You 
would not want the text to touch 
this border or it would become 
harder to read.

The border property allows you 
to specify the width, style and 
color of a border in one property 
(and the values should be coded 
in that specific order).

The margin property controls 
the gap between boxes. Its value 
is commonly given in pixels, 
although you may also use 
percentages or ems.

When you specify the width of 
a box, any padding or margin 
should be added to the width of 
it. Internet Explorer 6, however, 
has a quirk whereby it includes 
the padding and margins in the 
width of the box.

The display property allows 
you to turn an inline element 
into a block-level element or vice 
versa, and can also be used to 
hide an element from the page.

A Boolean variable can only have 
a value of true or fa 1 se, but this 
data type is very helpful. 


Programmers sometimes use 
shorthand to create variables. 
Here are three variations of how 
to declare variables and assign 
them values.

Once you have assigned a value 
to a variable, you can then 
change what is stored in the 
variable later in the same script. 

The logical AND is used to see 
if the user's score is greater 
than or equal to the pass mark 
in both of the rounds of the test. 
The result is stored in a variable 
called passBoth. 

A switch statement starts with a 
variable called the switch value. 
Each case indicates a possible 
value for this variable and the 
code that should run if the 
variable matches that value.

If you use a data type JavaScript did not expect, 
it tries to make sense of the operation rather 
than report an error.


Logical operators are processed left to right. 
They short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a 
result - but they return the value that stopped 
the processing (not necessarily true or fa 1 se). 

break 
This keyword causes the 
termination of the loop and tells 
the interpreter to go onto the 
next statement of code outside 
of the loop. (You may also see it 
used in functions.) 

A for loop is often used to loop 
through the items in an array.
