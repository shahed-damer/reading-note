CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they are positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window

Block-level elements
start on a new line
Examples include:
<h1> <p> <ul> <li>

Inline elements
flow in between 
surrounding text
Examples include:
<img> <b> <i>

If one block-level element sits inside another 
block-level element then the outer box is 
known as the containing or parent element.


A box may be nested inside 
several other block-level 
elements. The containing 
element is always the direct 
parent of that element.


Every block-level element 
appears on a new line, causing 
each item to appear lower down 
the page than the previous one. 
Even if you specify the width 
of the boxes and there is space 
for two elements to sit side-byside, they will not appear next 
to each other. This is the default 
behavior (unless you tell the 
browser to do something else).

width
This sets the width of the 
columns.
float
This positions the columns next 
to each other.
margin
This creates a gap between the 
columns.
