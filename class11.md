I can simply control the size of img by width and height in css
this is how i can alight the img 
<p><img src="images/magnolia-medium.jpg" 
 alt="Magnolia" class="align-left medium" />
 <b><i>Magnolia</i></b> 

 and i can use float to do that so
 the float float property is added 
to the class that was created to 
represent the size of the image .
I can  specify class names 
that allow any element to be 
centered, in the same way that 
you can for the dimensions or 
alignment of images.

repeat-x
The image is repeated 
horizontally only .
repeat-y
The image is repeated vertically 
only.

and i can use scroll so
The background image moves 
up and down as the user scrolls 
up and down the page

On-page techniques   
 i can use on my 
web pages to improve their 
rating in search engines.
