Images can be used to set the 
tone for a site in less time than 
it takes to read a description. If 
you do not have photographs 
to use on your website, there 
are companies who sell stock 
images; these are images you 
pay to use (there is a list of stock 
photography websites below). 
Remember that all images are 
subject to copyright, and you 
can get in trouble for simply 
taking photographs from 
another website.

src
This tells the browser where 
it can find the image file. This 
will usually be a relative URL 
pointing to an image on your 
own site. (Here you can see that 
the images are in a child folder 
called images — relative URLs 
were covered on pages 83-84).

height
This specifies the height of the 
image in pixels.
width
This specifies the width of the 
image in pixels.
Images often take longer 

When a picture has an area that is filled 
with exactly the same color, it is known as 
flat color. 

LAST RULE
If the two selectors are identical, 
the latter of the two will take 
precedence. Here you can see 
the second i selector takes 
precedence over the first.

X Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties 
of the element that you want to change, and the values 
of those properties. For example, the font-family 
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial 
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
X CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, 
although they may appear within an HTML page.

CSS treats each HTML element 
as if it appears in a box, and the 
background-color property 
sets the color of the background 
for that box.

Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, 
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.


hue
Hue is the colloquial idea of 
color. In HSL colors, hue is often 
represented as a color circle 
where the angle represents the 
color, although it may also be 
shown as a slider with values 
from 0 to 360.

alpha
This is expressed as a 
number between 0 and 1.0. 
For example, 0.5 represents 
50% transparency, and 0.75
represents 75% transparency.

Serif 
Serif fonts have extra details on 
the ends of the main strokes of 
the letters. These details are 
known as serifs.

CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to 
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

The user's computer needs the 
typeface installed. CSS is used to 
specify the typeface.

pixels
Pixels are commonly used 
because they allow web 
designers very precise control 
over how much space their text 
takes up. The number of pixels is 
followed by the letters px.

format
This specifies the format that the 
font is supplied in. (It's discussed 
in detail on the next page.)

normal
This causes text to appear in a 
normal style (as opposed to italic 
or oblique).

capitalize
This causes the first letter of 
each word to appear capitalized.

Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations.

Compression can be of two types — lossless and lossy. In lossless compression, it is possible to reconstruct the original image from the compressed image because there is no information loss during compression. This is not the case in lossy compression .
