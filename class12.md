that i can drow a line chart by create a canvas element in html in which chart.js can draw the chart .

I can style the canvas element like any img .

The <canvas> element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown. 


There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas:

fillRect(x, y, width, height)
Draws a filled rectangle.

strokeRect(x, y, width, height)
Draws a rectangular outline.

clearRect(x, y, width, height)


path is a list of points, connected by segments of lines that can be of different shapes, curved or not, of different width and of different color. A path, or even a subpath, can be closed.


rgba() gives  a little more control and flexibility because I can set the fill and stroke style individually.

 font property to make the text a bit larger than the default size.
