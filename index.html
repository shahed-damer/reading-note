<p>Part of the joy of gardening is learning about new plants and adding them to your garden. And there's always space for one more plant! To keep your garden looking amazing throughout the year, make sure to mix it up: Plant annuals for quick pops of color and perennials, which come back year after year, as well as spring-flowering bulbs, evergreens and flowering shrubs. There are even plants that bloom in winter before the snow has melted to provide color during the darkest days of the year! Variety in your plantings not only provides habitat and food for pollinators such as bees, hummingbirds and butterflies, but you'll also enjoy more color for a longer period of time.</p>
