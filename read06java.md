there is many types of operators 
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Arithmetic operators
Bitwise operators
Logical operators
String operators
Conditional (ternary) operator
Comma operator
Unary operators
Relational operators

 destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals.

 Bitwise logical operators
 The operands are converted to thirty-two-bit integers and expressed by a series of bits (zeros and ones). Numbers with more than 32 bits get their most significant bits discarded. For example, the following integer with more than 32 bits will be converted to a 32 bit integer

 JavaScript Loops
Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true


functions :
consists of the function keyword, followed by:
The name of the function.
A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.
Function expressions
While the function declaration above is syntactically a statement, functions can also be created by a function expression.
Calling the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters.
